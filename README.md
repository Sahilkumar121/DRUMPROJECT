## 🧠 How It Works

- Each button (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) is linked to a different drum sound and background image.
- When clicked (or when the corresponding key is pressed), a specific audio file plays using the `<audio>` API.
- The buttons also have individual styling and background images to simulate real drum pieces.


2. Make sure you have the following folders:

    . sounds/ — with all required .mp3 files (e.g., crash.mp3, kick-bass.mp3, etc.)
    . images/ — with background images (crash.png, kick.png, etc.)

3. Open index.html in your browser.
